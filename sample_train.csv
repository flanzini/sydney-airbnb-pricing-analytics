We have found it to be a very safe and friendly place to live. Clareville Kiosk opposite the beach is a must for a special lunch or dinner. There are many great cafes, restaurants and bars in Avalon, beautiful home wares shops to stroll through, a great bookstore and a lovely cinema. Just 10 minutes further north in Palm Beach, there is the iconic Boathouse for breaky or lunch, great Fish & chips, a fantastic walk up to Barrenjoey Lighthouse and ferries that open up the many beautiful beaches of Pittwater and the Central Coast.","Small families are very welcome.

The second loft room (containing 2 single beds) has block-out blinds to provide privacy from the rest of the Cabin. For young children, we have a portable cot with linen, high chair and a toy box as well. All linen is provided including sheets, bathroom and beach towels.

There is a large TV and DVD player and a collection of books, magazines and board games to relax with as well.

It’s home to Sydney’s most famous beach, great surf and in recent years has turned into one of the city’s hottest food and drink spots. Bondi Beach is as beloved for its laid-back bar scene and percolating cafes as it is for the backyard barbecues that fire up every weekend. Bondi and its surrounding beaches each have public barbecues to enjoy the splendour of the ocean with family and friends. Walk five minutes west from the beach and you’ll find quiet residential streets, small coffee spots and a vibe that encourages relaxation and rest.  You’re four minutes from Bondi Beach from our place and just two minutes to Bondi Icebergs, which is the start of the stunning Bondi to Bronte coastal walk and where the annual Sculpture by the Sea festival starts. If you seek to escape the buzz of Bondi for a day head to Bronte, the beach that time forgot, to enjoy its laid-back cafes, famous breakfast spots and natural rock pools.","It’s worth noting Sydney does have a tropical climate, and so there may be a few bugs about - nothing that would negatively impact your stay though!",Bondi Beach - 4 minute walk Bondi Junction Station - 16 minutes by bus Sydney CBD - 25 minutes by bus and train Darling Harbour - 35 minutes by train Harbour Bridge - 35 minutes by train Opera House - 35 minutes by train Centennial Park - 30 minutes by bus Airport - 50 minutes by bus,The apartment is within a communal block.
